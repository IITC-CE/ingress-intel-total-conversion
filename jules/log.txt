### Jules's Actions

1.  **Initial Response:** Okay, I will start a new branch `50822`, and create a folder `jules` to log all efforts, prompts and responses. First, I need to see what's in the current directory.
2.  **`ls()`:** I listed the files in the repository to get an overview of the project structure.
3.  **`mkdir jules`:** I created the `jules` directory as requested.
4.  **`read_file("README.md")`:** I read the `README.md` file to understand the project.
5.  **`set_plan(...)`:** I created a plan to log my activities.
6.  **`create_file_with_block(...)`:** I created `jules/log.txt`.
7.  **`replace_with_git_merge_diff(...)`:** I appended the initial prompt to the log file.
