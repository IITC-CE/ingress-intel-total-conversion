# iitc-unique-export

This is an IITC plugin to export/import your unique captures/visits from/to IITC as a JSON format.
The Uniques plugins and a functioning syncronisation is required, of course.

The exported/imported data consists of the Unique Portal ID, visited and captured status, all in JSON format.

Please note that when saving (=importing) the list of uniques any existing uniques will never be deleted, only updated.
